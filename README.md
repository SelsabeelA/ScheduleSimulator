## Description
The assignment is divided into: 
- **Non-Preemptive SJF** (8 marks)
    > using context switching.
- **SRTF** (10 marks)
    > with the solving of starvation problem using any way can be executed correctly
- **Non-Preemptive PS** (10 marks)
    > with the solving of starvation problem using any way can be executed correctly
- **AG Scheduling.** (32 marks)
- **Bonus** (10 marks)
   > graphical representation of Processes execution order
   
## Program Input 
- Number of processes 
- Round Robin Time Quantum
- context switching

For Each Process you need to receive the following parameters from the user:
- Process Name
- Process Color(Graphical Representation)
- Process Arrival Time 
- Process Burst Time
- Process Priority Numbe


## Program Output 
  For each scheduler output the following:
- Processes execution order
- Waiting Time for each process
- Turnaround Time for each process
- Average Waiting Time
- Average Turnaround Time
- Print all history update of quantum time for each process (AG Scheduling)
- BOUNS: graphical representation of Processes execution order
